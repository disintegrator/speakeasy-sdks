# RelationshipLinks

Links are used to allow you, as an API consumer, to move between requests. Single entities use a self parameter with a link to that specific resource. Sometimes, there arenâ€™t enough entities for a project to fill multiple pages. In this situation, we return some defaults, instead of expecting you to check for these special cases. 

 - current - Always the current page.
 - first - Always the first page.
 - last - always `null`.
 - next - `null` if the user is on the first page.
 - previous - `null` if there is only one page.
